## 📌 Project Overview

This is a demo web application that simulates a voice-driven interface for healthcare. The goal is to demonstrate how we might integrate voice input with a Machine Learning model to assess diabetes risk. The model considers glucose level and weather-related data to determine whether a user might be diabetic.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a simulation and **not** intended for real medical use.

## 💡 Motivation

This project was inspired by real-world challenges we observed in rural and under-resourced areas, where access to diabetes testing equipment like glucose meters is limited. Early diagnosis becomes difficult, especially in places without proper healthcare infrastructure.

By exploring **voice-based, non-invasive detection methods**, we aim to demonstrate how ML and simple interfaces could one day assist in scalable, accessible health screening—even without dedicated medical devices.

## 📚 Backed By Research

We referred to recent studies and advancements that validate the feasibility of AI-assisted voice analysis for diabetes detection:

- 🔬 [AI could detect diabetes using a 10-second voice clip – Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ai-10-second-voice-clip-help-diabetes-diagnosis)
- 📘 [Detection of diabetes mellitus based on voice features using machine learning methods (ScienceDirect)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949761223000731)

These studies highlight how vocal biomarkers and AI/ML techniques are being actively researched for real-world applications in healthcare.

## ⚠️ Limitations (If Fully Implemented)

 
  The accuracy of the ML model depends on the diversity and quality of the training dataset. It may struggle with underrepresented demographics or voice patterns.


  Background noise, low-quality microphones, or voice distortion can significantly impact accuracy.


  Performance may degrade for users with uncommon accents or speaking in unsupported languages.


  Any health-related prediction must undergo clinical trials and obtain certifications before deployment.

  
  Voice processing and inference hosted on cloud servers require stable internet, which may be a limitation in rural areas.


  Deep learning models may lack explainability, making it hard to interpret predictions and build user trust in high-stakes decisions.


  Running voice-enabled ML models locally may not be feasible on all devices, especially low-end smartphones.
